Jeopardy
\section{Description}
Jeopardy is a game show where contestants answer trivia questions.  Using questions and answers from past Jeopardy episodes, we will build a virtual Jeopardy trainer.  Different players can log on and compete for the highest score by answer Jeopardy questions.  They can choose to replay a show, answer questions from a category, or just answer random questions.  The database will keep track of all the questions as well as information about each player.
